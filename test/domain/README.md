# Dilatory

This is a sample application for demonstrating the use of [ddd-associations](https://github.com/nerab/ddd-associations), an implementation of object associations (like [ActiveRecord](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html)) that does not require any persistence layer to correctly model the object associations.

It also serves as the unit test bucket for [ddd-associations](https://github.com/nerab/ddd-associations).
